## Description                                                                        
This is a project for HackTuesGG 2021 made by team Chakalite&Co. Our goal is to make  
a site where you can recycle used resources.                                          
                                                                                      
## What have we done                                                                  
We started creating the HTML files for the different pages of the site, then played   
with CSS to make it look better. After that, we have made some animations with JS     
in the HTML files.                                                                    
                                                                                      
## What has to be done                                                                
We tried to make register and login system hosted on MongoDB but couldn't make it     
work.                                                                                 
*Listmaking function that can be triggered by a registered company.                  
*More detailed information about the companies requesting recycling goods
*Etc.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript(for animations)
And we will use more technologies for the final project. So you can register/login
and upgrade the whole site.
